# Code Samples from Project at Crossbeat NY: Tone It Up  
Here I have included Wordpress template (PHP) and SASS files for pages I coded from design comps. Each template file has a corresponding SASS file, which generally shares the same name.  

Also, samples of JS I wrote for this project can be found in:  
`scripts/common.js`

And some of the template files which I worked on for the site's e-commerce section (Shopify Liquid files) can be found in:  
`shopify/`
